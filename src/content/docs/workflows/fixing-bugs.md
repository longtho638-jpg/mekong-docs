# Fixing Bugs

Learn how to systematically investigate, fix, and verify bug fixes using AgencyOS's debugging workflow - from log analysis to production deployment.

## Overview

**Goal**: Debug and fix issues systematically with root cause analysis
**Time**: 5-20 minutes (vs 1-4 hours manually)
**Agents Used**: debugger, tester, code-reviewer
**Commands**: /fix:fast, /fix:hard, /fix:logs, /fix:ui, /fix:ci, /test

## Prerequisites

- Bug reproduction steps or error logs
- Development environment set up
- Access to relevant logs (if production bug)
- Test suite in place

## Choosing the Right Command

AgencyOS provides different debugging commands for different scenarios:

| Command | Use Case | Complexity | Time |
|---------|----------|------------|------|
| `/fix:fast` | Simple bugs, quick fixes | Low | 2-5 min |
| `/fix:hard` | Complex bugs, multi-file changes | High | 10-20 min |
| `/fix:logs` | Production issues from logs | Medium | 5-15 min |
| `/fix:ui` | Visual/layout bugs | Low-Medium | 3-10 min |
| `/fix:ci` | CI/CD pipeline failures | Medium | 5-15 min |
| `/fix:types` | TypeScript type errors | Low | 2-5 min |

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Reproduce the Bug

Before fixing, confirm you can reproduce the issue:

```bash
# Example: Bug report
# "Users can't login with valid credentials"

# Test manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}'

# Expected: 200 OK with token
# Actual: 401 Unauthorized
```

Document the issue:
- What happens (actual behavior)
- What should happen (expected behavior)
- Steps to reproduce
- Error messages or logs

### Step 2: Choose Debugging Approach

#### Option A: Quick Fix (/fix:fast)

For simple, isolated bugs:

```bash
/fix:fast [users getting 401 error on login with valid credentials]
```

**What happens**:
```

/fix:logs [analyze production error logs and fix the issue]
```

**What happens**:
```
[1/5] Analyzing logs...
  ✓ Read logs/production.log

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

Always verify fixes thoroughly:

```bash
# Run test suite
/test

# Manual testing
npm run dev
# Test the specific bug scenario

# Check for regressions
npm run test:integration
```

### Step 4: Document the Fix

Update documentation with the fix:

```bash
# Update docs
/docs:update [document the login bug fix and prevention measures]
```

**Generated documentation**:
```markdown
## Bug Fix: Login Authentication Issue

### Issue

### Root Cause
Password validation using == operator instead of bcrypt.compare()

### Fix Applied
Updated authentication logic to use proper async bcrypt comparison.

### Prevention
- Added test for bcrypt password validation
- Updated code review checklist
- Documented password handling best practices
```

### Step 5: Commit the Fix

```bash
/git:cm
```

**Generated commit**:
```
fix: resolve login authentication with valid credentials

- Fix password comparison to use bcrypt.compare instead of ==
- Add async/await for proper password validation
- Add test cases for password validation logic
- Update authentication documentation

Fixes: #123
```

## Complete Example: E-Commerce Cart Bug

### Bug Report

```
Title: Shopping cart duplicating items on page refresh
Severity: High
Impact: Users seeing incorrect cart totals

Steps to reproduce:
1. Add item to cart
2. Refresh page
3. Item appears twice in cart
4. Price incorrectly calculated

Environment: Production
Browser: All browsers
```

### Investigation

```bash
/fix:hard [shopping cart duplicating items on page refresh]
```

### Analysis Results

```
Root Cause Analysis:
1. Cart stored in localStorage
2. Also stored in database
3. On page load, both sources loaded and merged
4. Merge logic not checking for duplicates

Contributing factors:
- Missing unique key check
- No deduplication logic
- Improper state synchronization
```

### Implementation

```
Fixes applied:

1. src/store/cart.js
   - Add deduplication in loadCart()
   - Check by product ID before adding
   - Prioritize database as source of truth

2. src/utils/cart-sync.js
   - Implement proper sync strategy
   - Add conflict resolution
   - Clear localStorage after DB sync

3. tests/cart/sync.test.js
   - Add duplicate detection tests
   - Test localStorage/DB sync
   - Test refresh scenarios

4. docs/architecture/state-management.md
   - Document cart sync strategy
   - Add troubleshooting guide
```

### Verification

```bash
# Automated tests
✓ 15 new tests added
✓ All tests pass (187/187)
✓ Coverage: 89%

# Manual testing
✓ Add item to cart
✓ Refresh page
✓ Single item in cart ✓
✓ Correct price ✓
✓ Quantity correct ✓

# Regression testing
✓ Cart updates on quantity change
✓ Cart persists on navigation
✓ Cart syncs across tabs
```

### Time Comparison

**Manual debugging**: 3-4 hours
- Reproduce: 15 minutes
- Investigation: 60-90 minutes
- Implementation: 45-60 minutes
- Testing: 30-45 minutes
- Documentation: 30 minutes

**With AgencyOS**: 18 minutes
- Reproduce: 5 minutes
- /fix:hard: 12 minutes
- Verification: 1 minute

**Time saved**: 3+ hours (90% faster)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't Reproduce Bug

**Problem**: Bug doesn't occur in development

**Solution**:
```bash
# Use production logs
/fix:logs [analyze production logs to identify the issue]

# Or try production-like environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

### Issue: Fix Breaks Other Features

**Problem**: Fix causes regressions

**Solution**:
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
/test

# If tests fail
/fix:test

# Review all changes
git diff

# Consider alternative approach
/fix:hard [fix the login bug without changing the middleware]
```

### Issue: Root Cause Unclear

**Problem**: Can't identify why bug occurs

**Solution**:
```bash
# Use hard fix for investigation
/fix:hard [detailed description of symptoms]

# Provides thorough analysis
# Creates investigation plan
# Identifies root cause
```

### Issue: Intermittent Bug

**Problem**: Bug only happens sometimes

**Solution**:
```bash
# Add logging first
/cook [add detailed logging around the problematic area]

# Reproduce multiple times
# Collect logs
/fix:logs [analyze collected logs]
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Reproduce First

Before fixing:
```bash
✅ Reproduce the bug locally
✅ Document exact steps
✅ Capture error messages
✅ Note environment details

❌ Don't fix without reproducing
```

### 2. Add Tests for Bugs

Prevent regressions:
```bash
# After fixing
/test  # Includes new regression test

# Or add specific test
/cook [add test case for the login bug to prevent regression]
```

### 3. Check for Related Issues

Fix similar bugs:
```bash
# Search codebase
/scout "similar pattern to the bug" 3

# Fix all instances
/fix:fast [fix all instances of the password comparison bug]
```

### 4. Document in Changelog

Track bug fixes:
```bash
# Commit with fix: prefix
/git:cm

# Automatically added to CHANGELOG.md
# Links to issue number
```

### 5. Monitor After Deployment

Verify fix in production:
```bash
# After deploying fix
# Monitor logs for 24-48 hours
# Check error rates
# Verify user reports stopped
```

### 6. Root Cause Analysis

Understand why bug occurred:
```bash
# Use /fix:hard for analysis
# Documents root cause
# Suggests prevention measures
# Updates development guidelines
```

## Prevention Strategies

After fixing bugs, improve processes:

### 1. Add Validation

```bash
/cook [add input validation to prevent similar issues]
```

### 2. Improve Error Handling

```bash
/cook [enhance error handling with better logging and user messages]
```

### 3. Add Monitoring

```bash
/cook [add monitoring alerts for this type of error]
```

### 4. Update Code Standards

```bash
/docs:update [add this bug pattern to code review checklist]
```
