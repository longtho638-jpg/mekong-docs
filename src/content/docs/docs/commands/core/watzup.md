# /watzup

Quick review command that analyzes your current branch, recent commits, and code changes to provide a comprehensive summary of all work done. Perfect for stand-ups, code reviews, or understanding recent activity.

## Syntax

```bash
/watzup
```

## What It Does

The `/watzup` command provides a comprehensive overview of:

1. **Current Branch Status**
   - Active branch name
   - Comparison with main/master branch
   - Ahead/behind commit count

2. **Recent Commits**
   - Commit messages
   - Author information
   - Timestamps
   - Files affected

3. **Code Changes Analysis**
   - Files modified, added, or removed
   - Lines added/deleted
   - Change patterns and themes

4. **Overall Impact Assessment**
   - Features added
   - Bugs fixed
   - Refactoring done
   - Breaking changes (if any)

5. **Quality Evaluation**
   - Code organization
   - Test coverage impact
   - Documentation updates
   - Potential concerns

**IMPORTANT**: This command does NOT start implementation. It only analyzes and reports.

## Limitations

### What /watzup Does NOT Do

❌ Does not start implementation
❌ Does not modify code
❌ Does not create commits
❌ Does not deploy code
❌ Does not run tests

✅ Only analyzes and reports

### When NOT to Use

**Before Starting Work:**
```bash
❌ /watzup
✅ /plan [feature]
```

**When Implementing:**
```bash
❌ /watzup
✅ /cook [feature]
```

**When Fixing Bugs:**
```bash
❌ /watzup
✅ /fix [issue]
```
