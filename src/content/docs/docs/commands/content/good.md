Subject: "How Mekong Marketing generated 247 tests in 18 minutes"

Body:

Hey [First Name],

Remember Sarah's team from our last email?

Here's the full story of their first week with
AI-powered testing...

[Day 1]: Generated 247 tests in 18 minutes
[Day 3]: Found 8 bugs before production
[Day 7]: Achieved 94% test coverage

"We used to dread writing tests. Now it's automatic."
- Sarah Chen, Engineering Lead @ TechCorp

How it works:
1. Install Mekong Marketing CLI (1 command)
2. Run: mekong test generate
3. Review generated tests
4. Commit and push

That's it. No configuration. No prompt engineering.

Watch it in action: [3-min demo video]

Or try it yourself: [Start free trial]

[Your name]

P.S. Our Pro features trial ends in 4 days. Don't miss it.

(Sent 4 days after Email 2, to non-converters)

Subject: "Your Pro trial expires in 24 hours ⏰"

Body:

[First Name],

Quick heads up: Your free Pro trial expires tomorrow.

After that, AI testing returns to the waitlist.

What you'll lose access to:
❌ Automatic test generation
❌ E2E test creation
❌ 95%+ coverage guarantee
❌ Priority support

What you keep:
✓ Manual test writing
✓ Weekend debugging sessions
✓ Low test coverage stress

Just kidding (mostly) about the last two 😅

But seriously—500+ teams already activated their tests.

The setup takes 30 seconds.
The time saved: 20+ hours/month.

Ready? [Activate AI Testing Now]

Not for you? No problem. [Give us feedback]

[Your name]

P.S. Reactivating later means joining the waitlist.
Do it now while you can.
