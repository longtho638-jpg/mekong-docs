Research: Minimal
Variations: 3-5 options
Use case: Quick content needs
```

### /content:good

```
Speed: ⚡⚡⚡☆☆ 2-5 minutes
Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent

## Common Patterns

4. Social proof (if available)
5. Clear CTA
```

3. Specific benefit/outcome
4. Quick example
5. Try it CTA
```

### Company Milestone

2. What it means

## Troubleshooting

### Content Not Right Tone

**Problem:** Generated content doesn't match brand voice

**Solution:**
```bash
/content:fast [same request, but use professional and technical tone
like our brand voice in ./docs/brand-voice.md]
```

### Too Long for Platform

**Problem:** Generated content exceeds character limit

**Solution:**
```bash
/content:fast [same request, but keep under 280 characters for Twitter]
```

### Need More Variations

**Problem:** Want more options to choose from

**Solution:**
```bash
/content:fast [generate 10 variations instead of 5]
```

### Content Too Generic

**Problem:** Needs more specificity

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add specific details to request
/content:fast [same request but include that we have 50,000 users
and reduced coding time by 70% in beta testing]
```

## After Generation

Standard workflow:

```bash
# 1. Generate content
/content:fast [content request]

# 2. Review variations
cat content/fast/[type]-[timestamp].md

# 3. Pick favorite (or combine elements)

# 4. Customize if needed

# 5. Use in platform

# 6. Track performance
# (Engagement, clicks, conversions)
```

## Iteration

If first attempt isn't perfect:

```bash
# Original
/content:fast [write LinkedIn post about feature]

# Review output
# "Too formal, need more excitement"

# Iterate
/content:fast [write LinkedIn post about feature, but more excited
and use emojis, target developers not managers]
```

## Time Savings

Typical time to write manually vs `/content:fast`:

```
Social media post:    10 min → 8 sec   (75x faster)
Email subject lines:  20 min → 6 sec   (200x faster)
Ad copy variations:   30 min → 9 sec   (200x faster)
Product description:  15 min → 5 sec   (180x faster)
Headlines:           25 min → 7 sec   (214x faster)
```

- [/content:enhance](/docs/commands/content/enhance) - Improve generated content
- [/content:cro](/docs/commands/content/cro) - Optimize for conversion
