## 🤖 Quick Execute

```

```



Transform your web application into an immersive 3D experience. Build interactive 3D scenes, animations, and visualizations using Three.js and WebGL shaders with responsive design principles.

## Syntax

```bash
/design:3d [description of 3D experience]
```

## How It Works

The `/design:3d` command orchestrates a specialized workflow for 3D design:

### 1. Concept & Planning

- Invokes **ui-ux-designer** agent to understand requirements
- Defines 3D scene architecture and interaction model
- Plans performance budget and optimization strategy
- Identifies required assets (models, textures, shaders)

### 2. Three.js Setup

- Configures Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
- Sets up responsive canvas sizing
- Implements WebGL context management
- Adds performance monitoring

### 3. 3D Asset Creation

- Creates or configures 3D geometries
- Designs material systems (PBR, custom shaders)
- Implements lighting schemes (ambient, directional, point lights)
- Loads external models (GLTF, FBX, OBJ)

### 4. Interaction Design

- Implements orbit controls and camera movement
- Adds raycasting for object selection
- Creates hover and click interactions
- Designs touch gesture support for mobile

### 5. Animation & Effects

- Creates animation loops and timelines
- Implements particle systems
- Adds post-processing effects (bloom, depth of field)
- Designs shader effects (displacement, noise, distortion)

### 6. Performance Optimization

- Implements LOD (Level of Detail) systems
- Optimizes draw calls and geometry batching
- Adds frustum culling and occlusion
- Configures texture compression and mipmapping

### 7. Responsive Integration

- Ensures 3D scene scales across devices
- Implements mobile performance optimizations
- Adds progressive enhancement fallbacks
- Tests across different GPU capabilities

## Examples

## When to Use /design:3d

### ✅ Use /design:3d for:

- **Product Showcases**: Interactive 3D viewers for e-commerce
- **Hero Sections**: Immersive landing page experiences
- **Data Visualization**: 3D charts and graphs
- **Games & Experiences**: Interactive web-based games
- **Configurators**: Customizable 3D products
- **AR Previews**: WebXR-enabled product previews
- **Architectural Walkthroughs**: Building/space visualization
- **Creative Portfolios**: Unique 3D portfolio presentations

### ❌ Don't use /design:3d for:

- **Simple UI Elements**: Use regular HTML/CSS instead
- **Static Images**: Use 2D design tools
- **Heavy Applications**: Consider native apps for complex 3D
- **Low-End Devices Only**: Ensure broad device support requirements

## Best Practices

### Provide Clear Requirements

✅ **Good:**
```bash
/design:3d [create rotating 3D globe showing customer locations with animated connection lines]
/design:3d [abstract geometric shapes that morph on scroll with pastel colors]
/design:3d [car configurator with color, wheel, and interior customization]
```

❌ **Vague:**
```bash
/design:3d [make it look cool]
/design:3d [add some 3D stuff]
/design:3d [3D thing]
```

### Performance First

Always consider performance:
- **Mobile Devices**: Test on mid-range phones
- **Frame Rate**: Target 60 FPS, acceptable 30 FPS on mobile
- **Loading**: Show loading states, lazy load assets
- **Fallbacks**: Provide 2D alternatives for unsupported devices

### Accessibility Considerations

3D experiences should be accessible:
- Provide keyboard navigation alternatives
- Add screen reader descriptions
- Include skip links for main content
- Ensure color contrast in UI overlays
- Support reduced motion preferences

## Technical Specifications

### Three.js Stack

```typescript
// Typical setup generated
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls';
import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader';

const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
  antialias: true,
  alpha: true
});
```

### Shader Examples

**Custom Particle Shader:**
```glsl
// Vertex Shader
attribute float size;
attribute vec3 customColor;

varying vec3 vColor;

void main() {
  vColor = customColor;
  vec4 mvPosition = modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
  gl_PointSize = size * (300.0 / -mvPosition.z);
  gl_Position = projectionMatrix * mvPosition;
}

// Fragment Shader
varying vec3 vColor;

void main() {
  float r = distance(gl_PointCoord, vec2(0.5));
  if (r > 0.5) discard;
  gl_FragColor = vec4(vColor, 1.0 - r * 2.0);
}
```

### Performance Optimization Patterns

```typescript
// Instanced Geometry for repeated objects
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const mesh = new THREE.InstancedMesh(geometry, material, 1000);

// LOD for distant objects
const lod = new THREE.LOD();
lod.addLevel(meshHighDetail, 0);
lod.addLevel(meshMediumDetail, 50);
lod.addLevel(meshLowDetail, 100);
scene.add(lod);

// Frustum culling (automatic)
mesh.frustumCulled = true;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Frame rate drops below 30 FPS

**Solution:**
```bash
# Optimize existing 3D scene
/fix:fast [3D scene performance - reduce draw calls and optimize geometries]

# Common fixes applied:
✓ Merge geometries
✓ Use instanced meshes
✓ Reduce particle count
✓ Lower shadow map resolution
✓ Disable shadows on mobile

- Progressive texture loading
- Show loading screen with progress
- Lazy load non-critical assets
- Use texture atlases
```

### Mobile Compatibility

**Problem:** 3D scene not working on mobile devices

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add mobile support
/fix:ui [3D scene] - optimize for mobile with reduced quality and touch controls

# Automatically adds:
✓ Device capability detection
✓ Reduced particle count on mobile
✓ Lower texture resolution
✓ Touch gesture controls
✓ Disable expensive effects
