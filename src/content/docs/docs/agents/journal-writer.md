# Journal Writer Agent

Transform critical failures into brutally honest learning documents that capture technical details, emotional reality, and prevent future mistakes.

## When to Use

- Production down >30min or data loss
- Critical bugs caught before release
- Failed deployments causing outages
- Repeated issues team keeps hitting

## Key Capabilities

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| Honest Documentation | Captures what failed without sugarcoating - includes error logs, stack traces, timeline |
| Root Cause Analysis | Documents what was tried, why it failed, actual cause, systemic issues |
| Emotional Context | Records team stress, pressure, relief - builds psychological safety through honesty |
| Learning Extraction | Identifies lessons, prevention strategies, warning signs, process improvements |

## Common Use Cases

**DevOps Engineer** discovering payment race condition
```bash
/journal

Context: Found race condition in payment system 2hrs before release.
Bug causes duplicate charges when users rapidly click "Buy Now".
```
Output: Full incident report with code snippets, failed attempts (DB constraints, optimistic locking), final fix (Stripe idempotency keys), emotional timeline, lessons learned, checklist for future payment code reviews

---

**Backend Dev** after 6-hour production outage
```bash
/journal

Context: Kubernetes CrashLoopBackOff on all pods for 6 hours.
Rolled back - same error. No one knew why.
```
Output: Technical autopsy showing CI/CD silently failing (renamed npm script, old workflow config), cost breakdown ($16K revenue + support), 7 failed fix attempts, root cause (no build verification), new CI/CD checks added

---

**Tech Lead** documenting near-miss
```bash
/journal

Context: QA found SQL injection vulnerability in prod API.
Would have exposed 50K user records if exploited.
```
Output: Vulnerability details, attack vectors, immediate patch, systemic causes (no parameterized queries, skipped security review), new secure coding standards, team training plan

---

**Site Reliability Engineer** after Redis cluster split-brain
```bash
/journal

Context: Redis cluster split-brain during network partition.
Half the nodes thought they were primary. Data corruption.
```
Output: Network partition timeline, data inconsistency examples, recovery steps, why monitoring didn't catch it, new quorum configuration, chaos engineering tests added

---

**Full Stack Dev** documenting performance crisis
```bash
/journal

Context: API response times jumped from 200ms to 15sec.
Unindexed DB query on 10M row table hitting production.
```
Output: Slow query log, missing index discovery, query plan analysis, why staging didn't catch it (small dataset), new query performance testing requirements, database review checklist

## Pro Tips

- **Write immediately** - Emotional context fades fast, write while it's fresh
- **Include failed attempts** - Learning comes from what didn't work
- **Use real language** - "We f*cked up" not "encountered an unexpected issue"
- **Show the numbers** - Downtime cost, time to fix, impact metrics
- **Add code snippets** - Actual error logs, broken code, working fix
- **Make it searchable** - Someone will have same problem, use clear tags
- **Blame the system** - Not individuals - focus on process failures that allowed it

## AgencyOS Integration

```tsx
import { useAgentOS, AgentReport } from '@/agencyos';

function JournalPanel() {
  const { state, addArtifact } = useAgentOS({ agentName: 'journal-writer' });
  
  addArtifact({
    type: 'walkthrough',
    path: 'journals/incident-20251228.md',
    summary: 'Production incident postmortem'
  });

  return <AgentReport type="walkthrough" {...journal} />;
}
```

### Vibe Coding Pattern
```
/@journal document payment race condition
    ↓
Output: Incident report + lessons learned
```

## Key Takeaway

Journal Writer transforms expensive failures into permanent institutional knowledge through brutally honest documentation - capturing technical details, emotional reality, failed attempts, and systemic causes so teams learn once instead of failing repeatedly. Part of AgencyOS $99 toolkit.
