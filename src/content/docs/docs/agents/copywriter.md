## Pro Tips

**Conversion Psychology Baked In**
- Specificity wins: "85% faster" beats "much faster"
- User-centric: Benefits over features always
- Brutal honesty: Transparent about limitations builds trust
- Social proof: Real metrics, real customers, real results
- No hashtag spam: 1-2 max, focus on value not visibility

**Fast vs. Good Commands**
- `/content:fast [request]` - Single version, 30-60 seconds, good quality
- `/content:good [request]` - Multiple versions, research, A/B tests, 2-4 minutes
- `/content:enhance [issues]` - Improve existing copy
- `/content:cro [issues]` - Full conversion rate optimization

**Platform-Specific Optimization**
- **Twitter/X**: Hook in first 3 seconds, 8-12 tweets, 1 visual, no hashtags
- **LinkedIn**: First 2 lines critical (before "see more"), bullet points, ask questions
- **Landing Pages**: Hero headline 6-12 words, CTA every 1.5 screens, social proof near CTA
- **Email**: Subject 30-50 chars, personal tone, single CTA, mobile-optimized

**Quality Standards**
- Specific numbers: "Query 10M rows in 0.8 seconds" not "fast"
- Show don't tell: "Sarah created dashboard in 8 minutes" not "easy to use"
- Conversational: "Use our tool" not "Utilize our solution to facilitate"
- One primary CTA: Multiple actions confuse, single action converts

**Expected Performance**
- Landing pages: 3-5% trial signup rate
- Email: 40%+ open rate, 15%+ CTR
- Twitter: 5-10% engagement rate
- LinkedIn: 3-5% engagement rate
- Product pages: 8-12% add-to-cart

**A/B Testing Built In**
Every output includes test recommendations:
- Control vs. variant copy
- Specific hypotheses (e.g., "ROI-focused headline will convert better for budget-conscious CTOs")
- Metrics to track (trial signup rate, CTR, bounce rate)
- Expected performance ranges
