## Design Philosophies

The skill uses sophisticated aesthetic movements to guide visual creation:

- **Concrete Poetry**: Monumental form, bold geometry, sculptural typography
- **Chromatic Language**: Color as primary information system, geometric precision
- **Analog Meditation**: Quiet contemplation through texture and breathing room
- **Organic Systems**: Natural clustering, modular growth patterns
- **Geometric Silence**: Pure order, grid-based precision, dramatic negative space

Specify a philosophy in your prompt or let Claude choose based on your needs.

## Pro Tips

- Be specific about dimensions for target platform (web, social, print)
- Mention brand colors if consistency matters: "Use #3B82F6 as primary color"
- Specify DPI for print: "Export as PNG at 300 DPI"
- Request multi-page PDFs for presentations or coffee-table book style collections
- Text is always minimal - the design communicates visually, not through paragraphs
- **Not activating?** Say: "Use canvas-design skill to create..."
