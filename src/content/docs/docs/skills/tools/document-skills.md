## Pro Tips

- **Specify format details**: "Extract tables preserving merged cells" vs just "extract tables"
- **Chain operations**: Read → Process → Create in one request for efficiency
- **Use templates**: Faster than creating from scratch for consistent branding
- **Validate formulas**: Always recalculate Excel files after modification (`recalc.py`)
- **Batch processing**: Process multiple files in one request for large jobs

**Not activating?** Say: *"Use document-skills skill to [your task]"* or reference specific sub-skill like *"Use document-skills/pdf to..."*
