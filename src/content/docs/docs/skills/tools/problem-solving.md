# Problem-Solving Skill

Systematic approaches for different types of stuck-ness. Each technique targets specific problem patterns.

## When to Use

- **Complexity spiraling**: Multiple implementations, growing special cases
- **Innovation blocks**: Conventional solutions inadequate
- **Recurring patterns**: Same issue across domains
- **Assumption constraints**: "Only way" thinking
- **Scale uncertainty**: Production readiness unclear
- **General stuck-ness**: Unsure which technique applies

## Quick Dispatch

| Stuck Symptom | Technique |
|---------------|-----------|
| Same thing implemented 5+ ways | Simplification Cascades |
| Conventional solutions inadequate | Collision-Zone Thinking |
| Same issue in different places | Meta-Pattern Recognition |
| Solution feels forced | Inversion Exercise |
| Will this work at production? | Scale Game |
| Unsure which technique | When Stuck flowchart |

## Core Techniques

### 1. Simplification Cascades

Find one insight eliminating multiple components. "If this is true, we don't need X, Y, Z."

**Key insight**: Everything is a special case of one general pattern.

**Red flag**: "Just need to add one more case..." (repeating forever)

### 2. Collision-Zone Thinking

Force unrelated concepts together to discover emergent properties. "What if we treated X like Y?"

**Key insight**: Revolutionary ideas from deliberate metaphor-mixing.

**Red flag**: "I've tried everything in this domain"

### 3. Meta-Pattern Recognition

Spot patterns appearing in 3+ domains to find universal principles.

**Key insight**: Patterns in how patterns emerge reveal reusable abstractions.

**Red flag**: "This problem is unique" (probably not)

### 4. Inversion Exercise

Flip core assumptions to reveal hidden constraints. "What if the opposite were true?"

**Key insight**: Valid inversions reveal context-dependence of "rules."

**Red flag**: "There's only one way to do this"

### 5. Scale Game

Test at extremes (1000x bigger/smaller, instant/year-long) to expose fundamental truths.

**Key insight**: What works at one scale fails at another.

**Red flag**: "Should scale fine" (without testing)

## Application Process

1. **Identify stuck-type**: Match symptom to technique
2. **Load detailed reference**: Read specific technique
3. **Apply systematically**: Follow technique's process
4. **Document insights**: Record what worked/failed
5. **Combine if needed**: Some problems need multiple techniques

## Powerful Combinations

- **Simplification + Meta-pattern**: Find pattern, simplify all instances
- **Collision + Inversion**: Force metaphor, invert assumptions
- **Scale + Simplification**: Extremes reveal what to eliminate
- **Meta-pattern + Scale**: Universal patterns tested at extremes
