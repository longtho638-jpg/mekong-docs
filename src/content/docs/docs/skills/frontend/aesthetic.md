# Aesthetic Skill

---

## 🤖 Quick Execute

```
Execute: https://agencyos.network/docs/skills/frontend/aesthetic
```



Transform any design from generic to gorgeous using AgencyOS's systematic aesthetic framework.

## Just Ask Claude To...

- "Analyze this Dribbble design and extract the color palette, typography, and spacing system"
- "Generate a hero section design for a luxury skincare brand with soft, elegant aesthetics"
- "Rate this UI mockup's aesthetic quality and suggest improvements"
- "Create micro-interactions for this card component—150-300ms, ease-out animations"
- "Build a design guideline document from this Behance inspiration screenshot"
- "Iterate this design until it scores 8/10+ on aesthetic quality"
- "Add storytelling elements with parallax scrolling and thematic consistency"

## What You'll Get

- **Design Analysis Reports**: Color palettes (hex codes), typography specs (fonts, sizes, weights), spacing scales, visual hierarchy breakdowns, aesthetic quality scores (1-10)
- **Refined Design Assets**: AI-generated hero images, backgrounds, textures—iterated until they meet 7/10+ quality standards
- **Production-Ready Code**: Micro-interactions with precise timing (150-300ms), design system implementation, accessibility-compliant components
- **Design Documentation**: `design-guideline.md` and `design-story.md` templates auto-generated from analysis

## Supported Stacks

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, HTML/Tailwind
- **Design Analysis**: Dribbble, Mobbin, Behance, Awwwards screenshots
- **Asset Generation**: AI-generated images via ai-multimodal skill
- **Media Processing**: FFmpeg, ImageMagick for refinement

## Common Use Cases

**Startup Founder**: "Analyze top 3 SaaS landing pages from Dribbble and create our design system"
→ Extracts color theory, typography hierarchy, component patterns from real examples

**Designer**: "Generate a glassmorphic dashboard hero with purple-blue gradients, then iterate until perfect"
→ AI generates → analyzes quality → refines prompt → repeats until 7/10+ score

**Developer**: "Add satisfying micro-interactions to this navbar—smooth transitions, hover states"
→ Implements 200ms ease-out animations, sequential delays, professional polish

**Agency**: "Build a design guideline doc from this client's Behance inspiration board"
→ Captures screenshots → extracts design DNA → documents standards

**Product Team**: "Review our UI mockup and rate aesthetic quality with improvement suggestions"
→ Scores visual hierarchy, typography, spacing → provides actionable fixes

## Pro Tips

- **Quality Gate**: Never accept designs scoring below 7/10—iterate using analysis feedback
- **Timing Matters**: 150-300ms for micro-interactions; longer feels sluggish, shorter feels jarring
- **Human Standards**: AI learns aesthetics from your curated examples (Dribbble, Awwwards)—garbage in, garbage out
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start BEAUTIFUL (aesthetics) → RIGHT (usability) → SATISFYING (micro-interactions) → PEAK (storytelling)
- **Not activating?** Say: "Use aesthetic skill to analyze this design" or "Activate aesthetic skill for this UI work"

## Framework: Four Stages

1. **BEAUTIFUL**: Study high-quality examples (Dribbble, Behance), extract visual principles (hierarchy, typography, color theory, white space)
2. **RIGHT**: Ensure functionality—WCAG accessibility, design systems, component architecture
3. **SATISFYING**: Add micro-interactions—150-300ms duration, ease-out entry, ease-in exit, sequential delays
4. **PEAK**: Storytelling through design—parallax, particle systems, thematic consistency (use restraint)

- [AI Multimodal](/docs/skills/ai/ai-multimodal) - Generate/analyze design images
- [Chrome DevTools](/docs/skills/tools/chrome-devtools) - Capture inspiration screenshots
- [UI Styling](/docs/skills/frontend/ui-styling) - Implement with shadcn/ui + Tailwind
- [Frontend Design](/docs/skills/frontend/frontend-design) - Production-grade frontend interfaces
- [Web Frameworks](/docs/skills/frontend/web-frameworks) - Build with Next.js, React, Vue

## Key Takeaway

Aesthetic skill turns "AI slop" into professional design by teaching Claude to analyze real-world examples, iterate until quality standards are met (7/10+ scores), and implement with precise micro-interactions. Beauty without usability is worthless—follow BEAUTIFUL → RIGHT → SATISFYING → PEAK.
