## Pro Tips

- **Define aesthetic first**: Choose brutalist, maximalist, retro-futuristic, luxury, playful, editorial, industrial, or create your own. Commit fully.
- **Avoid generic patterns**: No Inter/Roboto fonts, no purple gradients on white, no cookie-cutter layouts. Be bold.
- **Match complexity to vision**: Maximalist needs elaborate code; minimalist needs precision and restraint.
- **Vary between projects**: Different themes, fonts, aesthetics each time. Never converge on Space Grotesk.
- **Extract before building**: When replicating screenshots, use ai-multimodal skill to extract colors, typography, spacing first. Document in `docs/design-guidelines/`, then implement.

**Not activating?** Say: "Use frontend-design skill to build this UI"
