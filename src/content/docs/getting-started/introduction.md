## What is AgencyOS?

AgencyOS is a comprehensive AI-powered operating system for agencies, featuring **18 specialized agents**, **125+ commands**, and **5 business suites** that automate marketing, sales, finance, strategy, and operations.

**System Overview**:
- **18 Specialized Agents**: From planner to debugger, copywriter to revenue optimizer
- **125+ Commands**: Organized across 5 business suites for every agency need
- **5 Business Suites**: Marketing 🔥, Sales 💼, Finance 💰, Strategic 🏯, Operations ⚡
- **Interactive Patterns**: Each command guides you with 5-9 contextual questions
- **WIN³ Framework**: Aligned for Owner, Agency, and Client success

### 5 Business Suites

| Suite | Focus | Example Commands | Key Agents |
|-------|-------|------------------|------------|
| 🔥 **Marketing** | Growth & Content | `/ke-hoach-tiep-thi`, `/seo`, `/pr` | copywriter, scout |
| 💼 **Sales** | Revenue & CRM | `/khach-hang`, `/crm`, `/leadgen` | researcher, planner |
| 💰 **Finance** | Budget & Reporting | `/bao-cao-tai-chinh`, `/ngan-sach` | planner, analyst |
| 🏯 **Strategic** | Planning & Intel | `/binh-phap`, `/intel`, `/crisis` | planner, researcher |
| ⚡ **Operations** | Dev & Automation | `/cook`, `/fix:*`, `/test`, `/docs:*` | developer, tester, debugger |

**Core Components**:
- **Agents**: 18 specialized AI assistants working in orchestrated workflows
- **Commands**: 125+ slash commands organized by business function
- **Skills**: Reusable knowledge modules (Next.js, Better Auth, Docker, Supabase)

## Two Usage Modes

AgencyOS operates in two complementary modes:

| Mode | Entry Point | Focus |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Mekong-CLI** | `python main.py` | Agency automation, deployment |
| **Claude Code** | Slash commands `/cook` | Software development |

**Mekong-CLI** (standalone Python CLI):
```bash
python main.py init my-agency
python main.py agents
python main.py deploy
```

**Claude Code** (requires IDE):
```
/cook add user authentication
/plan project roadmap
```

> **Note**: Slash commands like `/cook`, `/plan`, `/fix` require Claude Code IDE with AgencyOS installed.

## How It Works

1. **Invoke Command**: Type `/cook "add user authentication"`
2. **Interactive Questions**: System asks 5-9 contextual questions (auth provider? user roles? features?)
3. **Agent Orchestration**: Spawns 8-agent workflow:
   - `planner` → Creates implementation plan
   - `scout` → Analyzes existing codebase
   - `researcher` → Gathers best practices
   - `fullstack-developer` → Writes code
   - `tester` → Generates and runs tests
   - `code-reviewer` → Quality assurance
   - `docs-manager` → Updates documentation
   - `git-manager` → Commits with conventional format
4. **You Review**: Check output, provide feedback, iterate

## Why Use AgencyOS?

- **Speed**: 10x faster than manual prompting
- **Quality**: Battle-tested workflows reduce bugs and rework
- **Consistency**: Same approach across team members
- **Learning**: See how experts structure engineering tasks

## Quick Example

```bash
# Without AgencyOS
You: "I need to add authentication to my Next.js app"
Claude: "Sure! What auth library? What features?"
[20+ message back-and-forth]

# With AgencyOS
You: /cook "add authentication with Better Auth"
AgencyOS:
  ✓ Planner creates implementation plan
  ✓ Researcher analyzes codebase
  ✓ Developer writes code following best practices
  ✓ Tester runs tests and fixes issues
  ✓ Git commits changes
[Done in 1 command]
```
