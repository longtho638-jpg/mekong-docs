# Adding a New Feature

Learn the complete workflow for adding new features to your project with AgencyOS - from initial planning through production deployment with full testing and documentation.

## Overview

**Goal**: Add a complete feature with planning, implementation, tests, and docs
**Time**: 15-30 minutes (vs 2-4 hours manually)
**Agents Used**: planner, scout, tester, code-reviewer, docs-manager
**Commands**: /plan, /code, /test, /docs:update, /git:cm

## Prerequisites

- Existing project with AgencyOS configured
- Clear feature requirements
- Development environment set up
- Git repository initialized

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Define Feature Requirements

Start by clearly defining what you want to build:

```bash
# Start AgencyOS CLI
claude

# Define your feature
# Example: Adding password reset functionality
```

**Good feature descriptions:**
- "Add password reset flow with email verification"
- "Implement product search with filters and pagination"
- "Create admin dashboard for user management"

**Poor descriptions:**
- "Add password stuff"
- "Make search better"
- "Admin panel"

### Step 2: Research and Plan

Use the planner agent to create a detailed implementation plan:

```bash
/plan [add password reset flow with email verification]
```

**What happens**:
```
[1/3] Spawning researcher agents...
  ✓ Researcher 1: Email service best practices
  ✓ Researcher 2: Token generation patterns
  ✓ Researcher 3: Security considerations

[2/3] Analyzing project structure...
  ✓ Located authentication module
  ✓ Found email service configuration
  ✓ Identified user model

[3/3] Creating implementation plan...
  ✓ Plan saved: plans/password-reset-20251030.md

Review plan at: plans/password-reset-20251030.md
```

### Step 3: Review the Plan

```bash
# Read the generated plan
cat plans/password-reset-20251030.md
```

**Plan structure**:
```markdown
# Password Reset Implementation Plan

## 1. Database Changes
- Add reset_token field to users table
- Add reset_token_expires timestamp
- Create migration script

## 2. Backend Implementation
- POST /api/auth/forgot-password endpoint
- POST /api/auth/reset-password endpoint
- Email service integration
- Token generation utility
- Token validation middleware

## 3. Security Considerations
- Token expiry (15 minutes)
- Rate limiting (5 requests/hour)
- HTTPS enforcement
- Token single-use enforcement

## 4. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for token generation
- Integration tests for endpoints
- Email sending mocks
- Security tests for edge cases

## 5. Documentation
- API endpoint documentation
- User guide for reset flow
- Admin troubleshooting guide
```

**Review checklist**:
- ✅ All requirements covered
- ✅ Security considerations included
- ✅ Database changes documented
- ✅ Testing strategy defined

If plan needs adjustment, provide feedback:
```bash
"Please add SMS verification as an alternative to email"
```

### Step 4: Scout Existing Code (Optional)

For complex features, scout the codebase first:

```bash
/scout "Show me existing authentication code" 3
```

**Output**:
```
Found 8 relevant files:

Priority 1 (Core):
- src/auth/login.js (authentication logic)
- src/models/user.js (user model)
- src/middleware/auth.js (JWT middleware)

Priority 2 (Related):
- src/services/email.js (email service)
- src/routes/auth.routes.js (auth routes)

Priority 3 (Reference):
- tests/auth/login.test.js
- docs/api/authentication.md
- config/email.config.js
```

This helps understand existing patterns before implementing.

### Step 5: Implement the Feature

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/forgot-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com"}'

# Expected response:
# {
#   "message": "Password reset email sent",
#   "expiresIn": "15 minutes"
# }

# Check email (development)
# Open: http://localhost:8025 (mailhog/mailcatcher)

# Test reset with token from email
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/reset-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "token": "abc123...",
    "newPassword": "NewSecure123!"
  }'

# Expected response:
# {
#   "message": "Password successfully reset"

## Common Variations

### Variation 1: API Endpoint Only

```bash
# Skip planning for simple endpoints
/cook [add GET /api/users/:id/profile endpoint]
```

### Variation 2: Database-Heavy Feature

```bash
# Plan complex database changes first
/plan [implement multi-tenant architecture with tenant isolation]
/cook [implement multi-tenant architecture]
```

### Variation 3: UI + Backend Feature

```bash
# Split into separate features
/cook [implement backend API for notifications]
/cook [implement frontend notification panel]
```

### Variation 4: Third-Party Integration

```bash
# Research included automatically
/plan [integrate Twilio SMS notifications]
/cook [integrate Twilio SMS as planned]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Feature Too Large

**Problem**: Implementation taking too long or changing too many files

**Solution**:
```bash
# Break into smaller features
/plan [add user management - phase 1: user CRUD]
/cook [implement user CRUD]

/plan [add user management - phase 2: roles and permissions]
/cook [implement roles and permissions]
```

### Issue: Tests Failing

**Problem**: Generated tests don't pass

**Solution**:
```bash
/fix:test

# Debugger analyzes failures and fixes
# Re-runs tests automatically
```

### Issue: Missing Edge Cases

**Problem**: Implementation doesn't cover all scenarios

**Solution**:
```bash
# Add specific requirements
/cook [add error handling for network failures in password reset]
```

### Issue: Performance Concerns

**Problem**: Feature works but too slow

**Solution**:
```bash
# Add optimization
/cook [optimize search queries with database indexes and caching]
```

### Issue: Documentation Unclear

**Problem**: Generated docs don't explain feature well

**Solution**:
```bash
# Regenerate with focus
/docs:update [focus on password reset flow with diagrams]
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Plan Complex Features

For features requiring multiple components:
```bash
# Always plan first
/plan [feature description]
# Review plan
# Then implement
/cook [feature description]
```

### 2. Small, Focused Features

Break large features into smaller pieces:
```bash
✅ Good:
/cook [add user profile picture upload]
/cook [add image thumbnail generation]

❌ Too large:
/cook [add complete media management system]
```

### 3. Test Immediately

Don't skip testing:
```bash
/cook [feature]
/test           # Always run tests
/fix:test       # Fix failures immediately
```

### 4. Document as You Go

Keep docs current:
```bash
/cook [feature]
/docs:update    # Update docs immediately
```

### 5. Review Before Committing

Always review generated code:
```bash
# Review all changes
git status
git diff

# Understand what changed
# Only then commit
/git:cm
```

### 6. Use Feature Branches

Work safely:
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/password-reset

# Implement
/cook [feature]

# Commit
/git:cm

# Create PR
/git:pr main feature/password-reset
```
